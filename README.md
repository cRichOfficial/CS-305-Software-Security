**Artemis Financial**
+ The client in which Global Rain was contracted to to develop secure application for was Artemis Financial. Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that spcializes in developing individualized financial plans for clients. They specialize in a variety of products including savings, retirment, investments and insurance. Artemis Financial had tasked Global Rain with developing applications that utilized industry standard secure communications to ensure their client data is protected in transit and at rest.
+ When analyzing the existing application code and architecture for Artemis Financial, we at Global Rain were able to identify many areas of vulnerability and provide remediation in identified areas of vulnerability. A particular area of excellence we at Global Rain have identified was the ability to identify areas of vulnerability involving input validation when utilizing the Spring Framework and the Spring Expression Language plugins. This was achieved using static testing techniques that included manual code review as well as utilizing dependency checks at package installation. The identification of possible vulnerabilities surrounding a lack of input validation is of particular importance, as the lack of input validation violated secure coding practices for the project. Secure coding is a particularly important aspect of application development. Lack of secure coding practice can lead to vulnerability escapments that can cause financial injury to Artemis Financial's clients as well as erode client confidence toward Artemis Financial as an industry leader in financial services.
